These are the packages commonly used in the study:
- architecture.py introduces the classifier model classes (with/without convolutional layers) used in the project
- feat_extractor.py extracts the features from a simulation file or the psoterior from a posterior file
- hunt.py provides functions for bumphunting and performance computations
- localpaths.py introduces the link to the folders for data and posteriors (to be modified if these heavy files are in an external folder)
- style.py contains the standardized plotting style
- utility.py introduces a fucntion used for folder naming and one for the regularization of the log-posterior
