In this folder we provide the code for the simulations:
- [ALP_decay](ALP_decay.py) and [generate_dataset](generate_dataset.py) are the scripts for the simulations.
- the merge*.py files are used to merge different simulations outputs. [mergeh](mergeh.py) combines datasets horizontally (merge events), [merge](merge.py) combines datasets vertically (merge samples) and [merge_post](merge_post.py) combines the posterior files. 
- the files event_train contain the training samples. train_00 are bkg events for ECO/EPO, train_11 are sig events for ECO/EPO and train_post are the ones for training the posterior extractor. These large training files have been compressed and have lowered precision to make them easier to download. If you require larger samples and more precision, you can simulate the events from scratch.
- event_bkg are test samples for bkg events, event_sig are test samples for the sig (for three different benchmark masses 0.2GeV, 1GeV and 4 GeV as indicated in the name of the file).
- post_bkg_13_large and post_sig_8_large are the only posterior files provided for the case of poor resolution and a signal mass of 1GeV. Other posterior files need to be obtained from the provided data files.
